# How to Get Your Netlify Site ID

The Site ID is available even while your site is still deploying. Here's how to find it:

## Steps to Get Site ID

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - Visit https://app.netlify.com
   - Log in if needed

2. **Select Your Site**
   - Click on your site name from the list

3. **Open Site Settings**
   - Click on **"Site settings"** in the top navigation
   - Or click the **gear icon** ⚙️

4. **Find Site Details**
   - In the left sidebar, click **"General"**
   - Scroll down to **"Site details"** section

5. **Copy the Site ID**
   - Look for **"Site ID"** field
   - It looks like: `abc123-def456-ghi789-jkl012`
   - Click the copy button or select and copy it

## Using the Site ID

Once you have the Site ID:

1. In your terminal, with "Enter a project ID" selected, press **Enter**
2. Paste the Site ID when prompted
3. Press **Enter** again to confirm

This will link your local project to your Netlify site.

## Alternative: Site Name

You can also use your site name instead:
- The site name is usually visible in the dashboard
- It's the same as what appears in the URL: `https://your-site-name.netlify.app`
